I am deeply passionate about Threat Hunting, Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), and Malware analysis. I thrive on researching how to both attack and defend in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. Currently, I'm focused on learning how to hunt anomalies within various environments and understanding how attackers can evade defenses.
